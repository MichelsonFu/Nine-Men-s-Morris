# FIT3077_project

## Running the Program:
Run display.exe to start game or display.py from the command line if PyGame is installed.  
Final build contains an executable generated by PyInstaller but feel free to compile your own.

## Compiling with PyInstaller:
Pyinstaller is unable to recognise the resource folders we attach
with the game.  
If you want to compile this program into a binary, please follow the 
steps below.

**Importantly, it is possible to generate a single distribution folder,
but the resource files have to be manually moved in. 
At the time of writing the team does not know how
/ if it is possible to bundle everything into a single executable.**

NOTE: These commands **should** work on every operating system that you can install pyinstaller on.

Running 
> pyinstaller --onefile 

and 

> pyinstaller --onefile --add-file etc etc

does not work for some reason.

### Step 1:
Locate game_py folder.  
Make sure to save "res" and "sounds" folders to somewhere safe.  
`game_py/res`
`game_py/sounds`

### Step 2:
Open a terminal window in the same directory.  
Run the following command:  
> pyinstaller display.py

There should now be a folder named 'dist' created in the root directory now.
`game_py/dist`

### Step 3:
Copy the two saved resource folders into the following folder:
`game_py/dist/display`

You should be able to run the game from the `display.exe` file now.
